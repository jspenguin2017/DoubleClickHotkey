# Double Click Hotkey

Press <kbd>F8</kbd> to double click. This will not activate if one or more
modifier keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or
<kbd>Win</kbd>) are pressed.

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F8</kbd> to
toggle console visibility.

Other applications will not receive <kbd>F8</kbd> when one of the features
above is activated.

Copy the binary to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to
have it load on startup.

On Windows 11, hide console only works if the default terminal app is Windows
Console Host. This can be changed in `Settings > System > Advanced > Terminal`.

Intended to be used with Logitech Onboard Memory Manager.

Binary files in the Releases page are built using Visual Studio 2026 Community
Edition.
